## KoLMafia
KoLmafia is a cross-platform desktop tool which interfaces with the online adventure game, 
[Kingdom of Loathing](http://kingdomofloathing.com/). 
KoLmafia is written in Java (J2SE 1.5 compliant), with binary releases in JAR format. 
(Hourly .JAR releases live at [http://builds.kolmafia.us/](http://builds.kolmafia.us/)).

This is (a mostly read-only) git clone of the upstream SVN repo, [http://sourceforge.net/projects/kolmafia/](http://sourceforge.net/projects/kolmafia/),
sporadically updated from it.

Used for experiments in KoL scripting and automation.

For other KoL scripting projects, see:
 * [pykol](https://github.com/scelis/pykol) KoL scripting library written in Python
 * [kolproxy](https://github.com/houeland/kolproxy) is sort of a competitor to KoLMafia, written in Lua.
